### 1. What is NDVI : 
Understanding your crops’ health status isn’t the easiest thing to do. Sure, you can use the “eye test”, and a number of foliar contact and direct measurement techniques. But, what if there was an easy, fast and efficient way to see the health of plants and their status and progress over time? That’s where Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data comes in.

NDVI is a measure of the state of plant health health based on how the plant reflects light at certain frequencies.  

### How does Ndvi work?
As shown below, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses the NIR and red channels in its formula.

Healthy vegetation (chlorophyll) reflects more near-infrared (NIR) and green light compared to other wavelengths. But it absorbs more red and blue light.
